*This is an introduction to ..... regression, which is a non-parametric
estimator that estimates the conditional expectation of two variables
which is random. The goal of a kernel regression is to discover the
non-linear relationship between two random variables. To discover the
non-linear relationship, kernel estimator or kernel smoothing is the
main method to estimate the curve for non-parametric statistics. In
kernel estimator, weight function is known as kernel function

Miller (2025) investigates GAMs for identifying fraudulent financial statements, often hidden in complex accounting data. GAMs, combined with models like random forests, detect irregular revenue patterns and generate interpretable visualizations for auditors. Although effective, GAMs may miss sophisticated frauds involving multiple interacting factors. They provide a strong balance of accuracy and clarity for early detection of financial fraud.

In financial reporting, GAMs have been applied to detect fraudulent statements. Tragouda et al. (2024) compared GAMs with logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and random forests, showing that GAMs performed on par with more complex machine learning models while providing clearer interpretability. This interpretability allows auditors and regulators to understand why a financial report may be flagged, making GAMs highly practical in financial decision-making contexts.

Hanagandi et al. (2023) explore regularized generalized linear models, including Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet, for detecting credit card fraud in highly imbalanced datasets (0.17% fraud cases). These models, similar to GAMs, capture complex transaction patterns while remaining interpretable. Ridge regression achieved high accuracy (up to 98.2%). The study highlights that careful data preparation is crucial for effective real-time fraud detection in banking environments.

Brossart et al. (2015) discuss the application of GAMs to Medicare claims data for identifying fraudulent billing and overcharging. GAMs effectively detect unusual patterns and provide clear visualizations, which enhance auditor trust. While highly interpretable, they can be less adaptive to emerging fraud patterns compared to more complex models, but their transparency makes them valuable for healthcare fraud investigations.

Neural additive models (NAMs) extend GAMs using neural networks, improving their ability to detect fraud in financial datasets like credit card transactions. NAMs achieve high accuracy (AUC = 0.98) while remaining interpretable through visualizations. They outperform regular GAMs in complex scenarios, offering scalability and transparency, which helps financial institutions comply with regulations and assess bias.

Graph neural additive networks (GNANs) build on GAMs to detect fraud in networked data, such as transaction or social networks. GNANs analyze graph structures using neural networks while keeping results interpretable with simple visuals. They achieve strong performance (84.5% ROC-AUC) in tasks like spotting banned or suspicious users. GNANs help explain fraud in connected datasets and satisfy regulatory requirements for clear, auditable explanations.

## Methods

-   Detail the models or algorithms used.

-   Justify your choices based on the problem and data.

*The common non-parametric regression model is*
$Y_i = m(X_i) + \varepsilon_i$*, where* $Y_i$ *can be defined as the sum
of the regression function value* $m(x)$ *for* $X_i$*. Here* $m(x)$ *is
unknown and* $\varepsilon_i$ *some errors. With the help of this
definition, we can create the estimation for local averaging i.e.*
$m(x)$ *can be estimated with the product of* $Y_i$ *average and* $X_i$
*is near to* $x$*. In other words, this means that we are discovering
the line through the data points with the help of surrounding data
points. The estimation formula is printed below [@R-base]:*

$$
M_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} W_n (X_i) Y_i  \tag{1}
$$$W_n(x)$ *is the sum of weights that belongs to all real numbers.
Weights are positive numbers and small if* $X_i$ *is far from* $x$*.*

*Another equation:*

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 +\varepsilon_i
$$
